# DAT Auto Refresh

A simple browser extension that automatically refreshes DAT load board pages on a custom interval. Built to solve DAT's frustrating timeout behavior by keeping your session alive and your load board fresh. Feature to copy coworkers' posts in development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Auto-refreshes DAT load board every 15 minutes and 30 seconds
- Clean popup UI with start/stop toggle, timer, and refresh count
- Works with both Chrome and Edge
- Lightweight ‚Äî no tracking, no login credentials needed or saved

## üß± File Structure

```
background.js   # Manages alarms, state, and communication for timed refresh logic  
content.js      # Executes in-page refresh logic and coworker post copying via DOM manipulation

popup.html      # Extension popup layout and structure  
popup.css       # Styles the popup interface and supports light/dark themes

## üîÅ How It Works

Once installed:
- Navigate to your DAT **My Shipments** tab
- Click the DAT Auto Refresh extension icon to open the popup:

  ![Extensions Bar](Screenshots/extensions.png)

- Click **Start**
- The script will now auto-refresh your posts every 15 minutes and 30 seconds

Still refreshes when on a different tab or if browser is minimized. DAT tab must stay on 'My Shipments' to refresh.

If you close or restart the browser, you‚Äôll need to start the timer again manually.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

## üí¨ Known Issues

- Will refresh all posts listed on screen. If you're looking at other user's posts through Workgroup Shipments, those will be refreshed as well. This is NOT a bug and is intended so the user can refresh their team's posts if necessary.
